Test case 2: Entertainment Time Choice

The if statements so that each choice they make have a different outcome depending on how much time they spend on their phone etc.

Test Case 3: Study Strategy

Studying increases GPA (+0.2) but reduces social points.

If social points drop to 0, you die at this level.

Choosing a class not on the list also has consequences (reduced social points, possible failure if GPA is too low).
